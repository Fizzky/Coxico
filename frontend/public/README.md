# Logo Instructions

Place your Coxico logo image file here as `logo.png`.

## Requirements:
- **File name**: `logo.png` (or update all references to use your file name)
- **Recommended size**: At least 200px width (or larger for better quality)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG
- **Aspect ratio**: Flexible (the CSS will maintain aspect ratio)

## Alternative formats:
If you have a different format (`.jpg`, `.svg`, `.webp`), you can:
1. Name it `logo.png` (if it's not PNG, the extension doesn't matter as long as you update references)
2. OR update all `src="/logo.png"` references in the code to match your file name

## Where it will appear:
- Header/navigation bar (main site)
- Login page
- Sign up page  
- Password reset pages
- Admin panel header
- Admin panel login

Once you place your logo file here, it will automatically appear on all pages!
